Total cases of Covid-19 have reached past the 29 million mark in the United States. Though some states continue to enforce travel restrictions and quarantines, in general more states have been moving toward looser restrictions or none at all in recent weeks. The situation remain in flux, though.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still warns against nonessential travel at this time. If you do decide to travel to another state, it is vital that you stay updated on the latest statewide regulations.

Even if some US states have no restrictions on allowing leisure travel, all their official websites have important Covid-19 safety information. For instance, most states have mandates on face masks in public settings.
